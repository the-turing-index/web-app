<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![First Draft Map](./src/assets/docImages/roughMap.png)


![FirstNav](./src/assets/docImages/firstNav.png)


Just because we are learning remote, this doesn't mean you cannot enjoy the Turing campus experience. Come roam the digital halls of Turing and allow us to help you find your digital class room. Just because we are learning from home doesn't mean we can't experience basement life at Turing. As our final project we wanted to bring the Turing experience to future cohorts to enjoy, living the basement life.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
